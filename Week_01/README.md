## Java Bytecode
> Java bytecode is the instruction set for the Java Virtual Machine. It acts similar to an assembler which is an alias representation of a C++ code. As soon as a java program is compiled, java bytecode is generated. In more apt terms, java bytecode is the machine code in the form of a .class file. With the help of java bytecode we achieve platform independence in java.
